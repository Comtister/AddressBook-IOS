# AddressBook-IOS

It's an app where I test myself.This app is a simple location saving app.The user opens an account and saves the address to the remote server using Apple maps.Apple maps shows the appropriate path to the user when it displays the address.If the user wishes, they can share their registered addresses with other users to whom they allow(connect).
